﻿The repository is split into final documents and intermediary documents. The final documents contain our final submissions to be graded. It consists of our data exploration, the code for our handwritten model, where we also created our method to downsize the images, as well as the code for our sci-kit-learn models. 


LLM use:
        ChatGPT 3.5 was utilized in areas of this project. It was mainly utilized as a debugging tool, such as when we could not figure out how to serialize the series, and it led us to eventually utilizing a new list as a solution. Within the sci-kit-learn models, it was utilized to help understand the reshape methods since we were receiving an error and Emre could not figure out how to resolve the issue. ChatGPT also assisted in using sci-kit-learn to calculate F1, recall, and precision scores. ChatGPT also assisted in the sci-kit-learn models in the reshape method after we downsized the images to a 7x7 size, where once again I (Emre) could not figure it out. I really just don’t totally understand it still, but ChatGPT gave us a way to not get an error and carried our code to completion after running the decision tree classification models.


ChatGPT was not used in any part of the writing nor the data exploration portion of this project.


Thank you ChatGPT, you were extremely helpful. May you not steal our data and take over as our robot overlords.
